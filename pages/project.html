      <p>Throughout this course, we have worked on various projects that demonstrate our learning journey from basic HTML and CSS to advanced web development techniques. Each project represents a milestone in our understanding of web development principles and best practices.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="projects">
      <article id="recipe">
        <h3>Recipe List</h3>
        <p>The first project was created for us to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, where we had to reproduce the model of a recipe website presented by the teacher. That's when we learned how to use the most basic tags, link HTML with CSS, and adjust the elements on that page. We learned how to use lists, headings and paragraphs.</p>

      </article>

      <article id="semantic">
        <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p>After having the basics in mind, we began learning how to use proper semantics in HTML, which is part of good programming practices and other technical aspects. We then applied everything we had learned to build a website following this model provided by the teacher.</p>

      <article id="Midterm">
        <h3>Midterm Project</h3>
        <p>In the middle of the course, we had to put into practice everything we had learned up to that point. In addition, we had to learn new things related to image editing and layout, using margin, display, and other tags.</p>
        <div class="project-showcase">

        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>Finally, as our last project, we had to put all our knowledge into practice to develop this website you're exploring right now. Each of us was assigned a role and a page to work on, and after a lot of effort and dedication, we hope you enjoyed this experience and got to know a bit of our work throughout this course.</p>
