<article id="recipe">
    <h3>Recipe List</h3>
    <p>The first project was created for us to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, where we had to reproduce the model of a recipe website presented by the teacher. That’s when we learned how to use the most basic tags, link HTML with CSS, and adjust the elements on that page. We learned how to use lists, headings and paragraphs. Here is the model and above this the results:</p>

<div class="see-projects"> <a href="" class="cta-button">See the results</a></div>
</div>
</article>


<article id="semantic">
    <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
    <p>After having the basics in mind, we began learning how to use proper semantics in HTML, which is part of good programming practices and other technical aspects. We then applied everything we had learned to build a website following this model provided by the teacher:</p>

<div class="see-projects"> <a href="" class="cta-button">See the results</a></div>
</div>
</article>

<article id="Midterm">
    <h3>Midterm Project</h3>
    <p>In the middle of the course, we had to put into practice everything we had learned up to that point. In addition, we had to learn new things related to image editing and layout, using margin, display, and other tags. Here are the results if you want to check out:</p>

</div>
</article>

<article id="final">
    <h3>Final Project</h3>
    <p>Finally, as our last project, we had to put all our knowledge into practice to develop this website you’re exploring right now. Each of us was assigned a role and a page to work on, and after a lot of effort and dedication, we hope you enjoyed this experience and got to know a bit of our work throughout this course. Thank you very much.</p>
